Description: fast processor emulator
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4,
 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs. QEMU has
 two operating modes:
 .
  * User mode emulation: QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled for
    one CPU on another CPU.
  * Full system emulation: QEMU emulates a full system, including a
    processor and various peripherals. It enables easier testing and
    debugging of system code. It can also be used to provide virtual
    hosting of several virtual machines on a single server.
 .
 As QEMU requires no host kernel patches to run, it is very safe and
 easy to use.
 .
 This package is a metapackage depending on all qemu-related packages.
